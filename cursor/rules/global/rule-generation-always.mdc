# Global Development Rules

## Project Structure
- Maintain clear separation between backend and frontend
- Follow consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for files, classes, methods, and variables
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Use early returns to reduce complexity

## Documentation
- Document public APIs and complex business logic
- Keep README files up to date
- Include inline comments for non-obvious logic
- Update documentation when making significant changes

## Prompt Tracking - MANDATORY
**CRITICAL RULE**: You MUST save EVERY user request/chat message to `cursor/promts/` directory immediately after receiving it.

### Required Actions (MUST DO):
1. **Save immediately**: After receiving each user request, BEFORE responding, create a markdown file in `cursor/promts/` directory
2. **File naming format**: Use timestamp-based naming with current date/time: `prompt-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`
   - Example: `prompt-2024-01-15-143022.md` for January 15, 2024 at 14:30:22
   - Format: `prompt-{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}-{HHMMSS}.md`
   - Use 24-hour format (00-23 for hours)
   - Always include leading zeros (e.g., `09` not `9`, `05` not `5`)
3. **File content structure** (use this exact template):
   ```markdown
   # User Prompt - [Date and Time]
   
   **Timestamp**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
   
   **User Request**:
   [Paste the EXACT, COMPLETE user prompt/request text here - copy it verbatim. This means the actual message the user sent in the chat.]
   
   **Context**:
   - Files involved: [list any files mentioned, opened, or modified]
   - Action taken: [brief description of what you did in response]
   - Outcome: [result, status, or what was delivered]
   
   **Notes**:
   - [Any additional context, observations, or important details]
   ```

### Implementation Rules:
- **When**: IMMEDIATELY after receiving each user message, BEFORE you start processing it.
- **Where**: `cursor/promts/` directory (exact path - note the spelling "promts" not "prompts").
- **What**: Save the COMPLETE, EXACT user prompt text - copy it word-for-word. This refers to the specific text the user typed into the chat input.
- **Why**: Track all development progress, decisions, and maintain complete conversation history.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
- User asks: "Can you check the project and suggest rules?"
- Action: Create `cursor/promts/prompt-2024-01-15-143022.md` with the exact question text.
- Content includes: The question, what was checked, what rules were suggested.

**Example 2:**
- User asks: "there are a lot of problem during running backend"
- Action: Create `cursor/promts/prompt-2024-01-15-150530.md` with the exact error message text provided by the user.
- Content includes: The error text, what was diagnosed, what was fixed.

### Critical Requirements:
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Save EVERY user request - no exceptions. "Prompt" means the user's chat message.
- ✅ **IMMEDIATE**: Save before or right after responding - don't forget.
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Include the exact, full user prompt text.
- ✅ **CONSISTENT**: Use the same format for every prompt.
- ✅ **ACCURATE**: Use correct timestamp format with leading zeros.
- ❌ **DO NOT**: Skip saving prompts, even for simple requests.
- ❌ **DO NOT**: Modify or summarize the user's prompt - save it exactly as written.

### Verification:
After saving, verify:
- File exists in `cursor/promts/` directory
- Filename follows the timestamp format
- File contains the exact user prompt text
- File includes context about what was done

## Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use meaningful branch names
- Review code before committing

## Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Use appropriate exception types
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

## Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Performance
- Optimize database queries and avoid N+1 problems
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Minimize bundle sizes and optimize assets
- Lazy load components and routes when possible
