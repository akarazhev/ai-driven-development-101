**User Request**:
the following error appears during running the app: 2025-12-09T11:35:02.805+01:00 ERROR 22464 --- [confluence-publisher] [   scheduling-1] o.s.s.s.TaskUtils$LoggingErrorHandler    : Unexpected error occurred in scheduled task

org.springframework.transaction.CannotCreateTransactionException: Could not open JPA EntityManager for transaction
        at org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager.doBegin(JpaTransactionManager.java:466) ~[spring-orm-6.2.0.jar:6.2.0]
...
Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.GenericJDBCException: Unable to acquire JDBC Connection [path to './data/app.db': 'C:\Tasks\aidrivendevelopment\ai-driven-development-101\backend\.\data' does not exist] [n/a]
...
Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: path to './data/app.db': 'C:\Tasks\aidrivendevelopment\ai-driven-development-101\backend\.\data' does not exist
        at org.sqlite.SQLiteConnection.open(SQLiteConnection.java:261) ~[sqlite-jdbc-3.44.1.0.jar:na]

**Context**:
- Files involved: `backend/src/main/java/com/confluence/publisher/config/DataInitializer.java`, `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`
- Action taken: Analyzing the stack trace and the codebase to identify the root cause of the database connection failure.
- Outcome: Identified that the database directory creation logic might be failing or the path is incorrect for the SQLite connection.

**Notes**:
- The error `path to './data/app.db': 'C:\Tasks\aidrivendevelopment\ai-driven-development-101\backend\.\data' does not exist` suggests that the application is trying to access a directory that doesn't exist, even though there's initialization logic.
- It seems the path resolution for SQLite is stricter or different from what the `DataInitializer` prepares.
