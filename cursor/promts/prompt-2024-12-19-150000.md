  - `doc/course/06-project-confluence-publisher-app/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (reviewed)
  - `doc/course/06-project-confluence-publisher-app/M4_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (created)
  - Multiple test files created in `backend/src/test/java/com/confluence/publisher/`
- Action taken: 
  - Reviewed M4 requirements and current status
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan with 5 phases
  - Created todo list for M4 tasks
  - Started Phase 1: Testing Foundation
  - Expanded backend JUnit tests:
    - Created `AttachmentServiceTest.java` - tests for file upload, null handling, error cases
    - Created `ScheduleServiceTest.java` - tests for schedule creation, retrieval, status updates
    - Created `PublishServiceTest.java` - tests for publishing pages with/without attachments
    - Created `PageControllerTest.java` - integration tests for page endpoints
    - Created `AttachmentControllerTest.java` - integration tests for attachment endpoints
    - Created `ScheduleControllerTest.java` - integration tests for schedule endpoints
    - Created `ConfluenceControllerTest.java` - integration tests for publish endpoint
  - All tests follow existing patterns and use Mockito for mocking
- Outcome: 
  - Comprehensive test suite started for backend
  - Tests cover happy paths, error cases, and edge cases

**Notes**:
