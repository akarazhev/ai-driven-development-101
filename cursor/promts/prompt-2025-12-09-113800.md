**Context**:
- Files involved: `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`, `doc/CONFLUENCE_INTEGRATION.md`
- Action taken: Need to remove the hardcoded secrets from the codebase and ensure they are not in the history or current files.
- Outcome: Will sanitize the files and advise on how to handle the git history rewrite if necessary (though for now, just fixing the current files is the first step, but since it's a push rejection, the history *must* be cleaned or the secrets allowed). The user specifically asked to "exclude credentials and tokens from the project files".

**Notes**:
- The error indicates that secrets are committed in previous commits (hashes provided).
- I need to check `application.yml` and `doc/CONFLUENCE_INTEGRATION.md` and replace actual tokens with placeholders.
- Since the user is asking to "exclude" them, I will modify the files to use environment variables or placeholders.
- **Critical**: The user's push was rejected. Fixing the files *now* won't fix the *past commits* that the push contains. However, I can't easily rewrite their git history interactively. The best I can do is fix the files in the current working directory and explain that they might need to squash commits or use `git filter-repo` / `BFG` if they want to push clean history, OR use the "unblock" link if it's a test token. But the prompt implies they want to fix the code.
- I will focus on removing the secrets from the current file versions first.
