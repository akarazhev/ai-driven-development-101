# User Prompt - 2024-12-19 14:30:00

**Timestamp**: 2024-12-19 14:30:00

**User Request**:
there is a gloabal cursor rule which says: user prompts must be stored in the cursor/promts folder, but it doesn't store, under promt I meant each user request which was sent to the chat, can you double check and modify the current global rule to store it?

**Context**:
- Files involved: 
  - `cursor/rules/global/rule-generation-always.mdc` (updated)
  - `cursor/promts/` directory (verified exists)
- Action taken: 
  - Reviewed current global rule for prompt tracking
  - Updated the rule to be much more explicit and mandatory
  - Added detailed instructions with examples
  - Specified exact file naming format (timestamp-based)
  - Added template for prompt file content
  - Made it clear this is MANDATORY for every user request
  - Corrected directory path to `cursor/promts/` (noting the spelling)
- Outcome: 
  - Rule updated with comprehensive instructions
  - Rule now explicitly requires saving EVERY user request
  - Includes file naming format, content template, and verification steps
  - This prompt saved as demonstration

**Notes**:
- The directory is spelled `cursor/promts/` (not "prompts")
- Rule now emphasizes this is MANDATORY, not optional
- Added clear examples and verification steps
- Rule specifies to save BEFORE or immediately after responding
