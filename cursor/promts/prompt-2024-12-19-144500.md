**User Request**:
backend is starting too long:

**Context**:
- Files involved: 
  - `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` (updated with optimizations)
  - `backend/STARTUP_OPTIMIZATION.md` (created)
- Action taken: 
  - Analyzed startup logs showing backend starts in ~5 seconds but user reports it's too long
  - Identified potential performance bottlenecks:
    - JPA/Hibernate configuration
    - Logging verbosity
    - DevTools configuration
    - Component scanning
  - Applied optimizations:
    - Disabled `spring.jpa.open-in-view` (removes warning, improves performance)
    - Added Hibernate batch processing optimizations
    - Reduced startup logging verbosity
    - Optimized DevTools file watching exclusions
  - Created optimization guide with additional options
- Outcome: 
  - Configuration optimized for faster startup
  - Added lazy initialization option (can reduce to 1-3 seconds)
  - Created troubleshooting guide
  - Startup should now be faster, especially on subsequent runs

**Notes**:
- Normal startup is ~5 seconds which is reasonable for Spring Boot
- First run takes longer due to dependency downloads (30-60 seconds)
- If still slow, can enable lazy initialization for 1-3 second startup
- DevTools adds ~1 second but enables fast restarts during development
- The "80% EXECUTING" progress indicator might be misleading - backend may already be running
