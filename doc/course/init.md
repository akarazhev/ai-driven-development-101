# Issue 01: Create a basic structure for `AI-Driven Development Course`.

In this `ai-driven-development-101` project let's create a basic structure for a course about `AI-Driven Development` 
that will teach how to use AI to build software.

## Roles

Take the following roles:

- Expert technical course writer.

## Conditions

- The course will be written in the text format with images in the `markdown` format.
- The course will have each chapter in separate directory.
- Double-check your proposal and make sure that they are correct and haven't missed any important points.
- Implementation must be production ready.
- Use the best practices and design patterns.

## Constraints

- Use the current technological stack, that's: `python 3.13`, `markdown`, `contex 7`.
- Do not hallucinate.

## Tasks

- As the `expert technical course writer` create a basic structure of the course in the `doc/course` directory. 
  Each chapter should be in separate directory. The course will start with the introduction to AI, agents, then how to 
  configure the `cursor.ai` editor, then how to configure `contex 7`. Next chapter will be about how to use AI to build 
  software. Then we will build a web application that will automate posting to the social media texts and images. We are 
  going to follow best practices and design patterns.
- As the `expert course writer` double-check your proposal and make sure that they are correct and haven't missed
  any important points.
